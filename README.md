# Console Quest

## Introduction
The Food Randomizer application is an ASP.NET Core MVC project that allows users to explore a variety of foods by randomly generating food suggestions based on user-selected criteria. This application uses a backend API to fetch food items and provides users with filtering options for specific cuisines, keeping them engaged and helping them discover new foods.

## Motivation

FunWithFood was designed to help users decide on a meal when theyâ€™re unsure of what to eat. Beyond serving as a food randomizer, this project also aims to support aspiring ASP.NET developers by offering a practical introduction to the ASP.NET Core MVC framework. It provides a hands-on approach to understanding the MVC architecture and the flow of data between application and domain services.
